# CFE_IC_Flutter

Welcome to the CFE_IC_Flutter repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Flutter as a part of the Call for Enthusiast program for the Internal Committee of ICES Club. Here, I'll be documenting my progress, sharing insights, and possibly posting code and other resources as needed.
